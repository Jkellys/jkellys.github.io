          <Tool title="Sublime Text 4">
            I don’t care if it’s missing all of the fancy IDE features everyone
            else relies on, Sublime Text is still the best text editor ever
            made.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="VS Code">
            I use VS Code for all of my TypeScript and JavaScript work. It’s
            great for debugging and has a ton of great extensions.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="iTerm2">
            I’m honestly not even sure what features I get with this that aren’t
            just part of the macOS Terminal but it’s what I use.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="TablePlus">
            Great software for working with databases. Has saved me from
            building about a thousand admin interfaces for my various projects
            over the years.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Firebase">
            I use Firebase for all of my personal projects. It’s great for
            hosting, databases, and authentication.
          </Tool>

        <ToolsSection title="Design">
          <Tool title="Figma">
            We started using Figma as just a design tool but now it’s become our
            virtual whiteboard for the entire company. Never would have expected
            the collaboration features to be the real hook.
          </Tool>

        <ToolsSection title="Productivity">
          <Tool title="Click Up">
            We use Click Up for all of our project management. It’s a little
            overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of it, it’s
            incredibly powerful.
